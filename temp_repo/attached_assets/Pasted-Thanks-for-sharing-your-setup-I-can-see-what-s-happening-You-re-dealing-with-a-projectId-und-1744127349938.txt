Thanks for sharing your setup — I can see what’s happening.

You're dealing with a **`projectId` undefined error**, and from the code and environment you shared, I can confirm a few things need to be fixed.

---

## ✅ Issue Summary

The error:
```
Configuration must contain `projectId`
```

…is most likely coming from this part of your **Sanity config**:

```ts
createClient({
  projectId: import.meta.env.VITE_SANITY_PROJECT_ID,
  ...
})
```

But based on your `.env`:
```env
VITE_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=5enbinz3
```

You **do** have `projectId` defined — **so the most likely causes are**:

---

### 🔍 Root Causes

#### 1. You're not restarting the Vite server after `.env` changes
> 🛠 Fix: Run `npm run dev` again to reload the new env vars

#### 2. The `.env` file is not being loaded (Replit or wrong location)
> Make sure `.env` is in the root **of your Vite frontend project**

#### 3. You're trying to use `import.meta.env.VITE_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` in a file that executes **outside of Vite context**
> For example: If you're importing this `createClient()` file into the **backend**, `import.meta.env` won't work. That’s **frontend-only**.

---

## ✅ Actionable Fixes

### ✅ Step 1: Confirm `.env` File Is in Right Place

Your `.env` file must be in the **root directory** of your Vite (frontend) project — where `vite.config.ts` or `vite.config.js` lives.

Example:
```
/stackr-frontend
  ├── .env
  ├── vite.config.ts
  ├── src/
  └── index.html
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Log and Test the Variable

In the same file you use `createClient`, add this before it:

```ts
console.log('Sanity Project ID:', import.meta.env.VITE_SANITY_PROJECT_ID);
```

If this prints `undefined`, then the variable **isn’t loading properly** and you should recheck:

- `.env` location
- Spelling (no typos)
- That you restarted the dev server

---

### ✅ Step 3: Fallback to Direct Value (for testing only)

Temporarily hard-code the project ID to confirm:

```ts
export const client = createClient({
  projectId: '5enbinz3',
  ...
})
```

✅ If this removes the error, your `import.meta.env` is not being read correctly — and the fix is in `.env` setup or Vite config.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Restart Your Dev Server

After updating `.env`:

```bash
# Stop Vite dev server
CTRL+C

# Restart
npm run dev
```

---

## 🔒 Bonus: Avoid using `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=stackr-19160.firebasestorage.app`

This is incorrect.

It should be:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=stackr-19160.appspot.com
```

Because Firebase always uses `.appspot.com` for the storage bucket, **not `.firebasestorage.app`**.

---

## ✅ Next Steps

Let me know:
- If you’re using the `createClient()` inside a **backend file** (Node.js)
- Or if you'd like me to **refactor the Sanity/Firebase config** for you based on your project structure

I can also walk you through setting up `.env` for **frontend AND backend separation** for better practice as Stackr grows.
