💼 Finalized App Overview:
💸 Stackr – Smart Money, Your Way
Simple Breakdown
Stackr is your personal money planner that helps you control where your cash goes, how it grows, and keeps you consistent — even when life gets busy. It's built using the 40/30/30 rule:

40% Needs (rent, food, tools)

30% Savings (emergencies, van upgrade, future)

30% Investments (stock, business tools, growth)

🧠 Smart, Competitive Features of Stackr
✅ 1. Smart Planning Puzzle
Plan your money with visual pieces that guide every dollar home.

✅ 2. Goal Setting & Progress Tracker
Set savings goals and watch your journey in real time — like “New Work Van” or “$1,000 Emergency Fund.”

✅ 3. Cash Flow Coach Mode
Weekly AI challenges: “Stack $50 this week by reducing DoorDash” or “Reinvest $100 of excess income.”

✅ 4. Lock-Safe Envelopes
Drag and drop income into virtual envelopes with locking options for tools, fuel, savings, etc.

🔄 🔁 NEW: Stackr Smart Savings Rules Engine
“Stackr does it for you — so you can focus on your hustle.”

🧩 What Users Can Automate:
Recurring Rules (ex. “Every Monday, move 15% of all deposits to Savings”)

Income-Based Rules:

"If I earn more than $3,000 this month, save 20% of the excess"

"If an invoice is over $500, save $50 automatically"

Time-Based Rules:

"On the 1st and 15th, save $100 into Emergency Fund"

Round-Up Rules:

Every transaction rounds up to the next $1 or $5 — difference goes into savings

Challenge Mode:

Save $5 every time you log in

Save $10 every time you cancel a subscription

Seasonal Rules:

Adjust savings plan in slow months (great for locksmith seasonality)

Bonus Stack in high-revenue seasons

🧠 How It Works (Tech Overview):

React UI allows toggle/edit of each rule

Real-time visual feedback: “💰 You just stacked $25 with your Monday Rule!”
