Thanks for sharing your current `sanityClient.ts` — it's clean and error-aware, but the persistent error means that **`import.meta.env.VITE_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` is still undefined at runtime**, especially because you're using **Replit + Vite**, which requires **special handling for env variables**.

Let’s lock this down 👇

---

## ✅ Final Checklist to Fix `VITE_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` Being Undefined in Replit (Vite + React)

---

### ✅ 1. Use Replit’s Secrets Properly (not just `.env` file)

On Replit:
- `.env` files in the project folder **are not automatically available to Vite**
- You **must use the Secrets Manager**

#### 🔐 Do This in Replit:

Go to:
**Left Sidebar → 🔐 Secrets (Environment Variables)**  
Add the following **exactly** (no quotes):

| Key                            | Value                |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| `VITE_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`       | `5enbinz3`           |
| `VITE_SANITY_DATASET`          | `production`         |
| `VITE_SANITY_API_VERSION`      | `2023-05-03`         |
| `VITE_SANITY_TOKEN`            | your full token here |

✅ Make sure there are **no leading/trailing spaces**

---

### ✅ 2. Restart the Replit Server

Changes won’t take effect until you:
- 🔄 Stop the app
- ▶️ Run it again

---

### ✅ 3. Add Debug Logs (Keep these for now)

Add this before `createClient()` just to confirm:

```ts
console.log("Loaded Sanity ENV Vars:", {
  projectId: import.meta.env.VITE_SANITY_PROJECT_ID,
  dataset: import.meta.env.VITE_SANITY_DATASET,
  version: import.meta.env.VITE_SANITY_API_VERSION
});
```

If the output is:
```
Loaded Sanity ENV Vars: { projectId: undefined, ... }
```
Then **Replit didn’t inject the secrets**, and the app is still broken.

---

### ✅ 4. Fallback Workaround (for Testing Only)

Temporarily **bypass the env check** to test manually:

```ts
const client = createClient({
  projectId: '5enbinz3',
  dataset: 'production',
  apiVersion: '2023-05-03',
  token: 'your_sanity_token_here',
  useCdn: true,
});
```

If this works:
✅ Sanity is configured properly  
❌ You're just missing the environment binding inside Replit

---

## ✅ Bonus: Suggestion for Final Refactor

If you're planning to support both **local dev** and Replit, use this hybrid strategy:

```ts
const client = createClient({
  projectId: import.meta.env.VITE_SANITY_PROJECT_ID || '5enbinz3',
  dataset: import.meta.env.VITE_SANITY_DATASET || 'production',
  apiVersion: import.meta.env.VITE_SANITY_API_VERSION || '2023-05-03',
  token: import.meta.env.VITE_SANITY_TOKEN || '',
  useCdn: true,
});
```

---

Let me know if:
- You want to verify that data is actually pulling from Sanity
- You want to build a real-time tips dashboard from your CMS
- Or you're ready to deploy Stackr Studio to Sanity Cloud (`sanity deploy`)

You’re almost there. Let’s push this through 💪
